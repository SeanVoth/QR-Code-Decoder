#Description:
#This Python script captures an image from the Windows clipboard,
#checks if the image contains a QR code, decodes the QR code,
#and then saves the decoded information into a text file located at C:\temp\decoded_qr_code.txt.
#
#Note:
#- Make sure to have Python installed.
#- Dependencies: [Pillow ; pyzbar].
#    -- Pillow is a powerful Python Imaging Library fork. It is used in this script for image processing tasks, such as capturing screenshots and working with images.
#        --- pip install pillow
#    -- pyzbar is a Python wrapper for the ZBar barcode scanning library. It is used in this script to decode QR codes from images.
#        --- pip install pyzbar
